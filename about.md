The Global China project provides maps, data, and research on Chinese overseas engagement, including the Belt and Road Initiative, with the goal of giving the public a nuanced understanding of China's impact. 

The website contains a comprehensive dataset of China-financed projects, linked to satellite images, and aims to use maps as a tool to visualize and understand China's position in the world. 

The project views Global China as a complex entity with diverse actors and interests and aims to expand debates and enrich understanding through its research. 

The project was made possible by grants from New York University and Maria Adele Carrai.
